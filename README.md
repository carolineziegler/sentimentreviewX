# **Project Overview**

The literature review project explores the feasibility of developing a software tool capable of performing real-time sentiment analysis on Twitter. This tool is intended to help the startup Amtagio analyze public sentiment regarding their influencer-led marketing campaigns. Amtagio is new to the travel accessories market and focuses on maximizing the effectiveness of these campaigns to enhance its market presence.

## **Objective**

The main objective is to assess whether a €50,000 budget is sufficient to cover the development of a software tool that can provide real-time insights into public sentiment derived from Twitter data.

## **Scope**

The project will be developed over an ambitious 2–3 month timeline and will go through two main phases:
- Proof of Concept (POC) Phase: Test if the project is theoretically and practically feasible within the budget and timeline.
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Feasibility: Develop a basic, functional version of the software that can start providing early insights into the effectiveness of Amtagio's marketing strategies.

## **Technical and Data Considerations**
- **Data Accessibility and API Use:** Utilizes the Twitter API to fetch tweets, focusing on data like usernames, posting dates, and tweet content.
- **Development Tools:** Python and libraries such as Tweepy for API interactions, and TensorFlow for implementing machine learning models.
- **Sentiment Analysis Model:** Plans to employ BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for its advanced capabilities in understanding language context, which is crucial for accurate sentiment analysis.

## **Financial Feasibility**
- Initial Budget Assessment: Evaluates if the allocated €50,000 is adequate by forecasting development and operational costs.
- Long-term Cost Management: Considers the potential for cost overruns and explores scalability in terms of both technology and finances.

## **Challenges and Limitations**
- Language Limitations: The analysis will focus only on English tweets, potentially omitting significant market segments.
- Data Collection Restrictions: Limited to known user handles and historical data, which may not provide real-time insights.
- Regulatory Compliance: Includes GDPR considerations for data handling.
- Technical and Market Bias: Potential biases in Twitter’s user demographics and activity might skew analysis results.

## **Recommendations**

Suggests careful budget re-evaluation and potential increase to cover more extensive development and deployment needs, considering the high importance of influencer-led marketing for Amtagio.

## **Conclusion**

Concludes that while the project is technically feasible with existing tools and data access, financial feasibility for long-term sustainability needs careful evaluation against the added value for Amtagio.
